**This is a demo python package for UTK GEOG510**


-   Free software: MIT license
-   Documentation: <https://wnelso18.github.io/tight_loops>

    This is a simple python package that allows for geospatial analysis of vector and raster data. This package also includes another functionality that allows users to upload a .tif file and convert it into a .shp file showing contour lines of the original .tif file. This was created on top of Whitebox open-source GIS software. You can see how to use this function by going to the Examples folder, contour_tif, then opening the notebook in Google Colab. 

    Enjoy!
    

## Features

-   Adding geojson, shapefiles, basemaps, and other geospatial data to a map
-   Creating a map with multiple layers
-   Converting a .tif to contour lines
